This is a rebuild of What's This using Rails. [Github](https://github.com/girb0t/whats-this)/[URL](http://whats-this.herokuapp.com/) to original.

What's This is a take on pictionary telephone, a game where players alternate between drawing pictures based off captions and writing captions to describe pictures. The end result is a hilarious timeline that becomes more distorted with every turn.
